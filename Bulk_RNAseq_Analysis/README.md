# Bulk RNA-seq Analysis

**Tools Used:** DESeq2, edgeR  
**Goal:** Identify differentially expressed genes in brown adipose tissue between wild-type and Hoxa5 knockout mice.

## Methods
- Normalized count data using DESeq2.
- Performed differential expression analysis.
- Conducted pathways analysis.
