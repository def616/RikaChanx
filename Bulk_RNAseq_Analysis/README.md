# Bulk RNA-seq Analysis

**Tools Used:** DESeq2, edgeR  
**Goal:** Identify differentially expressed genes in brown adipose tissue between wild-type and Hoxa5 knockout mice.

## Methods
- Normalized count data using DESeq2.
- Performed differential expression analysis.
- Conducted downstream GO enrichment analysis.

> üîê Note: Due to data confidentiality, results are based on synthetic data resembling real distribution patterns.

## Script
See `DEseq2.Rmd` and `edgeR.Rmd` for the workflow.

## Sample Output
- Volcano plot of DEGs
- Heatmap of top 50 DEGs
