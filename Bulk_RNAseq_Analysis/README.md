## Description
This project investigates differential gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) between wild-type and Hoxa5 knockout mice using both DESeq2 and edgeR. While edgeR identified more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than DESeq2, many of these were driven by Y-linked genes such as Ddx3yâ€”highlighting sex-specific biases in the data. After excluding Y-linked genes, only the control Hoxa5 remained significantly differentially expressed, suggesting their strong influence on initial results.

The analysis reflects known limitations of DEG methods in small-sample RNA-seq studies and raises questions about the interplay between Hoxa5 and Y-linked gene expression. This work points toward a possible sex-specific regulation of BAT development, with implications for understanding metabolic differences between male and female mice.
